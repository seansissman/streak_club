# Streak Club

Streak Club is a pinned daily streak tracker for subreddits.

Members check in once per UTC day to build streaks, earn badges, unlock Freeze protection, and compete on a leaderboard.

---

## How It Works

• Members join the challenge  
• Check in once per UTC day (resets at 00:00 UTC)  
• Build a Current Streak  
• Earn Freeze protection every 7 days  
• Unlock badges at milestone streaks  
• Compete publicly (or stay private)

If a member misses one day and has a Freeze Token, their streak is protected.
